              <p>In her latest deep dive into a lesser known corner of the spirits world, Bernadette Pamplin explores the differences between Tequila and Mezcal. </p>
              <p>Not just a fascinating look at why it's so special, she also asks if mezcal really needs to be positioned differently to help establish it as a separate entity. </p>
